"""Publish a drop to the sales channels a scheduled launch had to leave behind.

Shopify only honours `PublicationInput.publishDate` on the Online Store -
"Only online store channels support future publishing". Passing a future date
to Shop, Google & YouTube or Facebook & Instagram does not schedule anything,
it publishes immediately, which puts the drop in front of shoppers days before
the store launch. So `publish_by_product_or_collection_id` publishes only the
Online Store whenever a scheduled time is given, and this mixin is what fills
in the rest once the launch has actually happened.

Nothing has to be scheduled per drop. `publish_by_product_or_collection_id`
tags what it defers `pending-channel-publish`, and the hourly sweeper
(brands/scripts/sweep_pending_publications.py, every shop) drains that queue:
publish with a scheduled_time and the other channels catch up on their own.
That is the whole point - the other channels are not time-sensitive, so a
developer should never have to remember them.

    client = utils.client("asheis")
    client.sweep_pending_channel_publishes(dry_run=True)   # the worker
    client.catch_up_other_channels_by_tag("26_oct_1")      # force one drop now
    client.unpublish_other_channels("26_oct_1")            # the repair

`catch_up_other_channels_by_tag` takes any tag, so it is also how a product
unpublished by hand gets back onto its channels: `unpublish_other_channels`
does not re-add `pending-channel-publish`, so the sweeper will not find it.

`main` below is a scratch block for those manual runs: edit it and run the
module, the way the other workflow mixins in this package are driven.
